          It's typical Portuguese pastry. Unfortunately, there is only one left... we will make a little game to decide
          who
          will get it.
          If a player guesses a secret number, he or she wins it!
        <br>

          We have selected a random number between 1 and 17. See if you can guess it in 3 turns.
          We'll hint you if the guess was too high or too low.
