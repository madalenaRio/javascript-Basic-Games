  It's typical Portuguese pastry. Unfortunately, there is only one left... we will make a little game to decide who will get it.
  If a player guesses a secret number, he or she wins it!
    <br>
  We have selected a random number between 1 and 17. See if you can guess it in 3 turns.
  We'll hint you if the guess was too high or too low.</p>
