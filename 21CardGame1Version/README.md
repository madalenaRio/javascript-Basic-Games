# This is my first attempt to make a - Black Jack 21 cards Game 

In this first try I attempted to begin with the css layout and HTML structure but because I still had no grasp of the Javascript logic I needed, I found it dificult to progress in good "flow logic". I keept changin the HTML structure and jumping back and forth on all tree files (js, HTML, Css) and losing a lot of time.
I decided therefor to stop, and begin a new folder repository.
In order to keep all the webpage development stages for evaluation porpuses I leave this pages has is.

On the second folder 21CardGame2version inside thi github repository you can find my finished version of this exercise.

*bellow is the context in wich this GitHub Repository was created*
